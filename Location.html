					<div id="jigsawreview"><h3><center>My name is **** and I am 13 years old.
						I first came to Jigsaw half-way through my first year of Secondary School when I began to struggle with social anxiety in particular. My school was very helpful and they introduced me to Jigsaw. 
						Working with Jigsaw was brilliant they gave me a better way of approaching my problems which helped significantly. After a few sessions I began to notice some positive changes in how I was coping. It was suggested to set some personal goals to aim for that helped me confront my issues but at my own pace.
						What I found great at Jigsaw was there patience and understanding, I was never forced to do anything or discuss anything I didn’t want to, everything happened on my terms. 
						The most important thing that I took away from my journey through Jigsaw is to get help when you need it and not to wait for your problems to get worse because getting help is not a sign of weakness it is a sign of strength.
						At the end of my final session at Jigsaw I felt coping with my anxiety was much easier than it was six sessions ago and that I could leave with a stronger and healthier mental state.</center></h3></div>

					<div id="jigsawreview"><h3><center>In 2006, Pieta House opened its doors in Lucan, County Dublin and since that day we have seen and helped over 30,000 people in suicidal distress or engaging in self-harm, and established twelve subsequent centres across Ireland.
						From humble beginnings, Pieta House has grown to almost 270 therapists and administration staff, and the demand for our service hasn’t let up. In 2016 alone, almost 6,000 people came through our doors suffering from suicidal ideation and/or engaging in self-harm, or to avail of suicide bereavement counselling.
						As it has been from day one, everything is free of charge and our staff are fully qualified and provide a professional one-to-one therapeutic service for people who are experiencing suicidal ideation, people who have attempted suicide and people who are engaging in self-harm. A doctor’s referral or a psychiatric report is not required.
						We’re passionate about our life-saving work. As 90% of our income comes from fundraising events, we rely heavily on the support and encouragement of our volunteers and friends of Pieta.
						Our flagship fundraiser, the phenomenon that is Darkness Into Light, an event that is almost entirely organised by our amazing volunteers continues to go from strength to strength. This unique event takes place just as we’re coming into summer and our spirits are being lifted. Hundreds of thousands of people have woken in the small hours of the morning and taken part in Darkness Into Light to date, and each year it touches the lives of many more in venues across the world.
						Darkness Into Light is very much about hope and hope is something we endeavour to give each person who comes to us in their time of need. We help them feel more hopeful about the future as we continue to tackle the grave issue of suicide and self-harm in Ireland.</center></h3></div>
